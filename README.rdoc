=Test Spec Script

This script accepts a directory path as an argument and converts all tests found there from test/spec to Rails 2.3+ standard test syntax.

Here's an example to get an idea of the change:

===before

  context "A new pair of running shoes", ActiveRecord::TestCase do
    it "should be comfortable" do
      RunningShoes.new.should.be :comfortable
    end
  end

===after 

  class ANewPairOfRunningShoesTest < ActiveRecord::TestCase 
    test "should be comfortable" do
      assert(RunningShoes.new == :comfortable)
    end
  end


==Usage

  ./convert-test-spec-to-test-unit engines/shoeshop/
